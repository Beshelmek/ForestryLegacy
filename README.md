Forestry
====================================

### What is it?

Forestry is a modification for the game Minecraft and known primarily for its farms and bees.

This is the last known source code containing old style farms. The code for the old style farms is horrible. You have been warned.

### Building

The build file was removed since it contained private information. You'll have to roll your own.

### Notes

Beware of ugly code. (Seriously!)

**Don't submit PRs to this repository, it's only for reference/code mining. Submit PRs against the main repository!**
