# 1.6.5.2

- Added: FruitProviders can now mark all, none or some leave blocks as fruit leaves. Fruit leaves will keep track of the elapsed "riping time". The speed at which it elapses is influenced by the sappiness of the tree. FruitProviders can alter texture and/or colour according to the riping time.
- Changed: Mutations will now result in a pure breed of the new species.
- Bugfix: Fixed saplings rerendering incorrectly before getting their tile data.
- Bugfix: Fixed germling spritesheet not being pre-loaded.
- Bugfix: Fixed pick block on half slabs.
- Bugfix: Fixed half slabs breaking instantly.
