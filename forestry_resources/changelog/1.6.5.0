- Added: Treebreeding and inheritance.

- Bugfix: Genetically modified saplings can now burn in furnaces.
- Bugfix: Fixed backpacks switching modes when emptying into chests.
- Bugfix: Electric engines now display MJ/t. (RichardG)
- API: Made backpacks more API friendly. Other mods should now be able to define their own. This may have broken a few things! Please test.
- API: Other mods can use IMC to add items to backpacks without needing to use the API. The message must be keyed 'add-backpack-items' and contain a string of the format 'backpackident@$id:$meta;$otherid:$othermeta...'. (Example: 'forester@2653:0;1233:5') Identical to the manual config.
