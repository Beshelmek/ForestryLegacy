#1.7.0.4

- Changed: Reduced the bandwith used by leaves on trees generated by forestry by about 87 %. This should also fix disconnect.overflow in high density forests in SMP.
- Bugfix: Fixed an issue that caused fruits (cherries, walnuts, chestnuts) to not spawn correctly, generating phantom fruits.
