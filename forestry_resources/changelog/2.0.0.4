# 2.0.0.4

- Added: Another Forestry update? Don't be sad, have a cocoa plantation!
- Added: Disabling the crafting recipes for the old farms will now unlock uncrafting recipes to turn planters and harvesters into 30 new farmblocks. Craft one harvester or planter with a single brick-like block. They block chosen will determine the type of the resulting farmblocks.
- Added: Facades for BC pipes in all types of logs and planks now available.
- Added: Support for IC2 rubber trees in the arboretum as well. (Requires an IC2 update.)
- Added: Config option to switch farms to using a square layout instead of a diamond shaped one. Server side config controls it.

- API: Same as above for "add-farmable-crop" and format "farmCereal@seedID.seedDamage.cropBlockID.cropMatureMeta".
