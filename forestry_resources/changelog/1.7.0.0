#1.7.0.0

- Added: Treebreeding and inheritance. Crossbreeding trees occurs when their leaves are pollinated by nearby bees.
- Added: 17 new, breedable trees. All trees can be bred from the vanilla four. (Log textures courtesy of Binnie.)
- Added: Trees can bear fruits, some fruits will require a ripening period.
- Added: Jungle trees have cocoa, oak apple, cherry trees cherries, walnut trees walnuts and chestnut trees chestnuts.
- Added: Both walnuts and chestnuts squeeze down to 0.2 buckets of seed oil, producing a tiny amount of mulch.
- Added: Config option to disable access restrictions on machines.
- Added: Treealyzer will auto-convert vanilla saplings to saplings with genetic information when analyzing them.
- Added: Fifth page in tree- and beealyzer to show information on classification and species descriptions.
- Added: Alternative sprites for bees to use in bee addons. (Courtesy of MysteriousAges.)

- Removed: Saplings from dungeon loot.
- Removed: Generational and mating info from trees to enable better stacking of saplings.

- Changed: Touched up the apiarist's chest gui slightly.
- Changed: Apple fruit leaves on oak trees do not show a fruit texture anymore.
- Changed: Beealyzer now shows information on the previously hidden chromosome which controls the speed at which bees pollinate.
- Changed: Empty letters are now stackable.
- Changed: Newly mutated Nether bees lost the trait giving them the fastest pollination speed. Significantly reduced all pollination speeds.
- Changed: Bees will now plant flowers in a vastly larger area. They still expect the first flowers to be in the nearer vicinity though.
- Changed: Increased chance for populated apiaries in beekeeper houses.
- Changed: Disabling the version check also disables it on startup.
- Changed: Impregnated casings only require 1/4th bucket of seed oil for production.
- Changed: Made space check for tree growth more tolerant.
- Changed: Blacklisted species are now listed as extinct on the analyzer info page.
