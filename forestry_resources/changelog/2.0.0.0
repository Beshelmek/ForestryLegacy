# 2.0.0.0

- Added: Multiblock farms with hatches, valves and gearboxes. Can be configured via circuit boards.
- Added: Added grafter item with 5 uses.
- Added: Alveary Hygroregulator to control humidity.
- Added: Stairs for Forestry woods.
- Added: Seperate tabs for Forestry mod items.
- Added: BC gate triggers for low soil and liquid on multiblock farms. Low soil will accept an item as a parameter.
- Added: Rubber plantation for multiblock farms when IC2 is installed. Works similar to an orchard.
- Added: 5x5 variant of multiblock farms. (Hi CPW!)
- Removed: Bonus to sapling drop rate on leaves. Use your grafter!
- Changed: New textures for apatite, apatite ore, fertilizer. Apatite ore now drops between 0 and 5 gems per ore block, works with fortune.
- Changed: Soldering iron can now switch between different layouts for the electrical engine, managed farms and manual farms. The layout determines the effect of an electron tube.
- Changed: Bonemeal now works on fruit leaves.
- Changed: Removed generational data from drones. Should improve stacking behaviour significantly.
- Changed: Refactored alveary to use single block id. Will update existing apiaries.
- Changed: Alvearies and farms will now keep their inventory even if broken. Only breaking the master block will eject items.
- Changed: Alvearies and farms can be owned like any other machine.
- Changed: New textures for copper and tin ore.
- Changed: Ore gen slightly. Apatite does not spawn below Y=60 anymore. Copper needs at least Y = 32, tin Y = 16.
- Changed: Ash cannot be used to create fertilizer anymore. It can be mixed with existing fertilizer to double it though.
