# 2.0.0.3

- Changed: Alvearies and apiaries now accept the full stack of drones when piping into them.
- Changed: Orchards now require 10 fertilizer per operation instead of 5. Arboretums 30 instead of 40.
- Changed: Harvest phase does not consume fertilizer anymore, however actually collecting the crop will, leading to a uniform per crop cost instead of giving an advantage to tree-like crops.
- Bugfix: Fixed soldering iron eating tubes if a circuit board was inserted first.
- Bugfix: Fixed sapling placement sounds again.
- Bugfix: Fixed sipiri tree not actually being breedable.
- Bugfix: Fixed piping bees into alvearies.
- Bugfix: Moving an apiary via frames or gravigun should now also reset the biome. (RichardG)
- Bugfix: Fixed peat-fired engines not ejecting waste into pipes.
- Bugfix: Fixed stairs not removing associated tile entity when broken.
- Bugfix: Fixed stair placement consuming two stairs instead of one.
- Localization: Several updates to ES-variants, CN and others.
